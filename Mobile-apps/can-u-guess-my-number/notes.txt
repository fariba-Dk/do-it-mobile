hook from REACT LIBRARY


 ------  state  in React Native ---
to be able to register a newState

we call useState
set it to " " bc initially user input state is blank
or my journalEntered  which
gets updated to setJournalEntered

So:
first we have journalEntered which is ''
with every key stroke we updated

const[journalEntered, setJournalEntered] = useState('')

function textHandler(enteredText) {    ***** enteredText *****
    setJournalEntered(enteredText)
  }

we'll pass enterText as
  function buttonHandler() {
    console.log(journalEntered)
